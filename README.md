This tool is helpful for creative purposes (i.e. build a wall and "paint" windows into it).
It replaces nodes with a previously selected other type of node (i.e. places said windows
into a brick wall).

Crafting:   (nothing) stick (nothing)
            (nothing) stick (nothing)
            (nothing) empty_bucket (nothing)
Or just use /giveme replacer:replacer

Usage: Right-click on a node of that type you want to replace other nodes with.
       Left-click (normal usage) on any nodes you want to replace with the type you previously right-clicked on.

When in creative mode, the node will just be replaced. Your inventory will not be changed.

When not in creative mode, digging will be simulated and you will get what was there. In return, the replacement node
will be taken from your inventory.
